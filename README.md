# RwaLink

**RwaLink** is a cross-chain Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization platform built on [ERC-7943 (uRWA)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7943), enabling compliant, scalable, and unified deployment of RWA tokens across multiple EVM-compatible blockchains. The project leverages [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) for seamless cross-chain function execution and messaging.

## üåê Overview

RwaLink allows institutions to issue, transfer, freeze, and manage RWAs on the blockchain of their choice and automatically reflect the changes across all configured chains. The core design eliminates the complexity of managing fragmented deployments across chains and provides a consistent, secure, and compliant experience.
